I did a google search called "deploy a cluster kubernetes with ansible"
I'm using the link "https://buildvirtual.net/deploy-a-kubernetes-cluster-using-ansible/"
I have some problems, but the tutorial is working
Updating the playbooks with the link "https://devopscube.com/setup-kubernetes-cluster-kubeadm/"
